            <p>Tamil is the official language of this state, as well as Sri Lanka and Singapore. Tamil (also written as
                Tamizh) is one of the oldest classical languages still being spoken today. They also believe that
                serving food to others is a service to humanity. Traditionally, meals were served on banana leaves. One
                part of the leaf held the rice-based foods.</p>

            <p>Tamil Nadu has the largest bus terminal in Asia and the greatest number of international airports in
                India. Together, they make Tamil a major welcoming center for the country’s tourists.With many factories
                and numerous ports, Tamil is also one of the most industrialized states in India. In fact, Tamil has
                three major ports (Chennai, Ennore, and Tuticorin) — more than any other Indian state.</p>

            <p>Bharathanatyam is the traditional dance of Tamil Nadu. Other folk dances include Kolattam, Karagattam,
                and Mayilattam. This video shows the beauty and elegance of this classical Indian dance form. Pongal,
                Tamil Nadu’s Harvest Festival, literally means “spilling over.” It’s a major celebration of abundance
                and bounty, and it happens every year in January.</p>
