                            <li><p>Outsiders are often surprised to hear about Tallital and Mallital. In the local Kumaoni language, Talli means Lower and Malli means upper, so the area below the Lake is referred to as Tallital and the area above it is called Mallital.</p></li>
                         <li><p>Few people know that during the British Raj, Nainital was the summer capital of the United Province. The Raj Bhawan of Uttarakhand, which is situated in Nainital, was built for the governor of the United Province. The British usually escaped to Nainital to escape the extreme heat of Lucknow.</p></li>
                         <li><p>Nainital is called the Lake District of India, just like Cumbrian in Britain. There are many freshwater lakes here like- Bhimtal, Sattal, Khuraptal and Naukuchiya Tal. The British were drawn to Nainital because its climate and location was similar to Cumbrian.</p></li>

                         <li><p>Its sounds funny but its true. Due to the lake on its northern end, it rains almost every afternoon in Nainital</p></li>
                         <li><p>The British wanted to join Nainital by rail. Surveys revealed that Nainital was prone to landslides, so special technology was to be used. However, before this scheme could be finalized India gained freedom and the dream to join Nainital with Kathgodam by rail never came true.</p></li>
