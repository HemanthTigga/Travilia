                                    centuries ago. You can also see the Taj Mahal through the slits in the wall of Jodha
                                    Bai’s palace in Agra Fort.</p>

                                    in 1500. In turn, the Agra Fort served as a model for Shah Jahan’s Red Fort in
                                    Delhi.</p>

                                    It is located close to Vishwanath Temple and is probably the most spectacular ghat.

                                <p>Two Hindu legends are associated with it: according to one, Brahma created it to

                                <p>The present ghat was built by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao in the year 1748. A few decades
                                    later, Ahilyabahi Holkar, the Queen of Indore rebuilt the ghat in the year 1774.
                                    Close to the ghat, overlooking the Ganga lies the Jantar Mantar, an observatory
                                    built by Maharaja Jai Singh of Jaipur in the year 1737.</p>

                                <p>Ganga Aarti (ritual of offering prayer to the Ganges river) is held daily at dusk.
                                    Several priests perform this ritual by carrying deepam and moving it up and down in
                                    a rhythmic tune of bhajans.</p>

                                <p>The Ganga Aarti starts soon after sunset and lasts for about 45 minutes. In summer
                                    the Aarti begins at about 7pm due to late sunsets and in winter it starts at around
                                    6pm. Hundreds of people gather at the ghat every evening to watch the event.</p>

                                    the Indian Mujahideen claimed responsibility for it.</p>
