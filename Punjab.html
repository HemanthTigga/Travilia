            <p>The word Punjab is made from two Persian words; ‘Panj’ means five and ‘aab’ means water. Five major

            <p>Before the partition of India in 1947, Punjab was a large state in British India. After Partition, Punjab
                divided into two regions; Indian Punjab and Pakistani Punjab. The modern Indian Punjab came into
                existence on 31 October 1966 when Himachal Pradesh and Haryana were carved out.</p>

                was formed. It was a secular empire based in Punjab. It lasted until 1849.</p>

                                    Mian Mir. This was done to spread a message that this sacred gurudwara is open to
                                    all faiths. There are four entrances to the temple which shows openness to all

                                    considered sacred by the devotees. Before offering prayers, they bath in the holy

                                    also an iconic structure in the city. Constructed ages ago, this fort is of national

                                <p>The visit to the historical fort will take you down the memory lane. This place has
                                    been here for ages and has seen many rulers during its time. It was also the place
                                    where the Empress of Delhi, Razia Sultan, was kept as a prisoner after she was
                                    dethroned.</p>

                                    they should be avoided to take a trip to Bathinda Fort.</p>

                                    should take a trip between October and March. This is the time when the weather is
                                    balmy and pleasant and the vegetation is in its full bloom. Monsoons should be

                                <p>The train is by far the best way to reach Bathinda since you will find a number of
                                    trains connecting Bathinda to other parts of the country. This is because Bathinda
                                    is a big junction. New Delhi-Bathinda Intercity Express and Dadar-Amritsar Express
                                    are some of the trains that run between Delhi and Bathinda.</p>
